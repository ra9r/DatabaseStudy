# DatabaseStudy App
The purpose of this application is to provide a common UI that enables me to explore various 
database options for SwiftUI applications.  

The UI is able to perform all essential CRUD operations.  The baseline application is an in-memory
version of the Todo list application concept.  

## Branching Conventions
Branches will be created for each exploration of a supported database solution.  Examples are:

* [`firestore`](https://github.com/firebase/FirebaseUI-iOS/)
* [`realm`](https://realm.io/realm-swift/)
* [`core-data`](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/how-to-combine-core-data-and-swiftui)
* [`cloud-kit`](https://developer.apple.com/icloud/cloudkit/)
* [`json-file`](https://programmingwithswift.com/how-to-save-json-to-file-with-swift/)
* [`sureal`](https://surrealdb.com/)
